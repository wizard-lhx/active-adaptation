"""
Backend-agnostic helpers for resolving names to indices.

Isaac Lab and MuJoCo expose slightly different APIs for looking up bodies and
joints. These functions normalize on the articulation's simulation name lists
(`joint_names_simulation`, `body_names_simulation`) so call sites get indices
and ordering that match the asset, not an arbitrary backend layout.
